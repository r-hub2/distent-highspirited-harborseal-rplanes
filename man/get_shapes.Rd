\title{Determine shapes}
\usage{
get_shapes(input_data, window_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame containing at least two columns, one of which must be named "value" with the value assessed and another named "dates" with the date for the observed data}

\item{window_size}{The number of of categorical differences used to define the shape}
}
\value{
A vector with the shapes identified. Each element of the vector will include a shape, which is a cluster of categorical differences (of the same size as the specified "window_size") collapsed with ";" (e.g., \code{c("decrease;stable;stable;stable","stable;stable;stable;increase","stable;stable;increase;increase")}).
}
\description{
This unexported helper function is used to identify the shape in the \code{plane_shape()} function's scaled difference ("sdiff") method.
